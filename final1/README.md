### Description
This map shows information for the current day's AA meetings in Manhattan.  Each map marker represents a physical venue. The end user is shown the venue name, address, and an icon for wheelchair access if the venue has it.  Each meeting has a start time to end time, with a meeting type. Meetings are grouped by meeting name/topic. This is the most relevant information to be displayed partly due to space constriants and crowding of content.
